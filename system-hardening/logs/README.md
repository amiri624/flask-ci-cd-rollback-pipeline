# Logs Folder

This folder contains all the logs generated by the hardening script.

- Each run of harden.sh creates a log file with timestamp:
  harden_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
- world_writable_files.txt contains a list of world-writable files found during the scan.
- Logs help track changes made by the script and debug if needed.

Usage:
- Check the latest log file after running the script:

cat logs/harden_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log

- Review world_writable_files.txt to identify and fix insecure file permissions.
